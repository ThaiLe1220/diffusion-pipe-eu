# INSTALLATION LOG SUMMARY:
# - Environment created successfully with Python 3.12
# - PyTorch 2.7.1 + CUDA 12.8 installed from PyTorch index
# - CUDA toolkit (nvcc 13.0.48) installed via conda from nvidia channel
# - CUDA_HOME environment variable setup was critical for DeepSpeed compilation
# - All 29 requirements installed successfully, including:
#   * DeepSpeed 0.17.0 (built from source)
#   * Flash-attention 2.8.1 (built from source)
#   * All other ML dependencies (transformers, diffusers, accelerate, etc.)
# - Final verification: PyTorch CUDA detection working (1 GPU), DeepSpeed imported successfully
# - Key fix: Setting CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX allows DeepSpeed to find conda-installed nvcc
# - Total installation time: ~10-15 minutes with compilation of DeepSpeed and flash-attn
